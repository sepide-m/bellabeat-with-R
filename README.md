# Bellabeat Case Study – Google Data Analytics Capstone

Welcome to my capstone project for the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**, where I analyze smart device data from **Bellabeat**, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women.

This project follows the full data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act — using R and Tableau to generate insights and recommendations.
